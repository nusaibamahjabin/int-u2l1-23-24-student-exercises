<p>Hi my name is Nusaiba! I am a sophmore at Queens Technical High School. I was born in Bangladesh and came to America when I was five. <br> I love art, designing, meeting new people and having fun. I have never counted myself as a tech person, I've always been insecure about my tech experiance but now I'm overcoming my fear and trying something that I never thought I will be able to do(code). But look at me now!!! I wrote this, and it might not be a lot but I'm getting there.</p>
    <!-- 5. After the third sentence in your bio, add a break tag. -->
